## Company Environment and Career Development

### Main idea

- To show differences between various types of companies and its impact on (not only) career development.
- Company types that we should attempt to cover are freelancer/small company vs IT corporation; IT vs non-IT company; civil service. 
- Startups are intentionally ignored as they have their own session later on. 

## Question proposals
- How would you define THE career?
- Would you mind doing same job for next five years?
- What you consider as main benefit for your company type?
- How often do you solve problems with non-IT people?
- What would you like to "remove" from your usual schedule?

## Activities for students

- survey (multiple-choice): Work experience ~ academic, internship, self-employed, part-time, full-time, none
- survey (single-choice): Would you prefer to work for IT or non-IT company ~ IT, non-IT, it is not important
- survey (multiple-choice): How high you have to be on the career ladder in order to talk about "successfull" career? ~ positions from career ladder
